## Some Results

Particle volume fraction prediction (red) compared to OpenFOAM data (black dots) for the inverse problem with known velocity data via a SA-PINN with self-adaptive weights, a Gauss expansion layer, and the finite difference method used for calculating derivatives within the PDE loss:

The scripts are formatted similarly, where any differences have to do with the problem itself and are mentioned above. 

## Methodology

See [documentation.pdf](documentation.pdf) for a thorough review of the methodology in regards to PINN architecture and loss handling.

## How to Run

	1.	Train a Ux model (synthetic or experimental)
	2.	Predict ϕ using your preferred script (Gauss expansion, Fourier expansion, etc.)

	or 

 	1. Ux and phi are trained simultaneously and within the same script for the forward problems
