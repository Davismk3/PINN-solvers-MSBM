# Predicting shear-induced particle migration in channel flow with Physics-Informed Neural Networks

This repository contains PyTorch implementations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which learn the known velocity profile of fluid through a small channel, and use this along with enforced physical laws to approximate the unknown particle-volume-fraction profile of particle suspensions. 

The script **`pinn_sbm.py`** reproduces **Case 1** of the SBM study by Dbouk *et al.* (2013).
